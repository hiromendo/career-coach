      sector at Millennium, a contrarian stance that proved highly prescient during a period when
      such flows became a primary driver of stock dispersion.

* Prominently feature **performance metrics** where possible (e.g., ">1 Sharpe ratio").
* Detail **specific impactful investment calls and their outcomes** (e.g., "single-handedly found a \$30bn enterprise value company that was wildly misunderstood," "successfully pushed to short leveraged energy companies ahead of large oil price declines").

**Critical Observation & Action:** Your resume uses the "Analyst" title (Millennium, Citadel) despite
responsibilities characteristic of portfolio management (e.g., "autonomously ran an \$850mm carve-out,"
"built out and managed the oil & gas portfolio").

**Strategy:** Proactively bridge this gap in your resume summary, cover letters, LinkedIn, and interviews.
Emphasize autonomy, capital deployment responsibility, risk management, and impact on portfolio performance.
This ensures consideration for roles commensurate with your actual experience, like the "Equity Long Short -
Energy Portfolio Manager" position (Selby Jennings) seeking individuals managing significant books of business.¬≥
