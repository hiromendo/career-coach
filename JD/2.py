    Professionals who can bridge the gap between the old and new energy worlds—those who understand the

    The energy transition is not a simple replacement of one energy source with another; it involves
    intricate financial reallocations, the repurposing or decommissioning of existing assets, and the
    development of entirely new value chains. Expertise in traditional energy markets provides a crucial
    lens for assessing stranded asset risks, understanding the interplay between conventional and renewable
    power generation, and identifying investment opportunities in enabling technologies (e.g., carbon
    capture, hydrogen) that may complement or integrate with existing energy systems.

    New York City and New York State have enacted some of the most ambitious climate policies in the

    reduction in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2050) and NYC's Local Law 97 (imposing
    stringent carbon emission caps on large buildings).² These legislative mandates create a
    non-discretionary, long-term demand for companies and public entities to invest heavily in
    decarbonization, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. This, in turn, fuels a consistent need
    for finance professionals skilled in structuring and funding these investments, performing carbon
    accounting, ensuring ESG compliance, and managing climate-related financial risks.

    Unlike purely market-driven finance sectors, the demand for these roles in NYC is underpinned by
