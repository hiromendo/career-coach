    Begin by clarifying whether you want to pursue a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) license or aim for accounting roles that don't require CPA certification. This decision will shape your next steps.

    * **Factors to Consider:** Kinds of jobs desired (public accounting vs. private industry), time/effort for CPA, long-term career growth.
    * **CPA Path:** Opens doors to higher-level roles, especially in public accounting and some corporate positions.
    * **Non-CPA Path:** Roles like bookkeeper, staff accountant, accounting manager can be rewarding but might have different advancement paths.
    * **Importance:** Knowing your target path helps prioritize licensing, education, and job search efforts.

Oregon allows sitting for the exam with 120 hours (degree + required courses), but 150 hours needed for license. [Source: OR Board Town Hall](https://www.oregon.gov/boa/Documents/2023_Fall_Town_Hall_Meeting_Presentation.pdf). Requires rigorous study (300-400+ hours). Pass a separate ethics exam (often AICPA Professional Ethics course). [Source: Oregon CPA Requirements 2024-2025](https://www.ais-cpa.com/oregon-cpa-requirements/).
    * **Experience:** 1 year (approx. 2,000 hours) full-time accounting experience supervised and verified by a licensed CPA (can be in public, industry, government, or academia). Check with Board if prior work qualifies; often needs to be recent or post-exam. [Source: Oregon CPA Requirements 2024-2025](https://www.ais-cpa.com/oregon-cpa-requirements/).
    * **Licensing Application:** Submit application, fees, transcripts, scores, experience verification, ethics proof. Requires 4 hours Oregon-specific ethics CPE for initial license/first renewal. [Source: OAR 801-010-0130](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=288791). Maintain active license via biennial renewal (80 hours CPE).

    * **Lapsed Oregon License:** Reinstatement possible. Requirements increase with time:
