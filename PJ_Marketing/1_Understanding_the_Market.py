**Flexibility Matters:** While some employers prefer onsite (e.g., Rejuvenation [9]), many offer hybrid (e.g., Morningstar [2]) or fully remote options (e.g., Affirm [6]). This expands your search pool to include companies hiring remotely in OR/WA and roles in nearby Vancouver, WA.[7] A local presence is often advantageous, but don't discount remote opportunities.
