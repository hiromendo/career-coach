    Begin by clarifying whether you want to pursue a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) license or aim for accounting roles that don't require CPA certification. This decision will shape your next steps.

    * **Factors to Consider:** Kinds of jobs desired (public accounting vs. private industry), time/effort for CPA, long-term career growth.
    * **CPA Path:** Opens doors to higher-level roles, especially in public accounting and some corporate positions.
    * **Non-CPA Path:** Roles like bookkeeper, staff accountant, accounting manager can be rewarding but might have different advancement paths.
    * **Importance:** Knowing your target path helps prioritize licensing, education, and job search efforts.

    After 10+ years away, updating your knowledge is crucial.

    * **Accounting Principles & Standards:** Review major updates in GAAP or tax law (e.g., revenue recognition, lease accounting).
    * **Technology:** Familiarize yourself with current software (QuickBooks, ERPs like Oracle/NetSuite/SAP) and advanced Excel. Data analysis tools are increasingly common. Consider certifications (e.g., QuickBooks Online).
    * **Continuing Education:** Enroll in refresher courses or CPE seminars. Portland Community College (PCC) offers an [Accelerated Accounting certificate](https://www.pcc.edu/programs/accounting/accelerated-accounting/) covering basics and tech (Excel, payroll).
    * **Self-Study:** Read trade publications (e.g., *Journal of Accountancy*, *FM Magazine*), subscribe to accounting news, engage with professional networks. [Source: FM Magazine](https://www.fm-magazine.com/news/2023/jun/how-re-enter-finance-after-extended-leave.html).
