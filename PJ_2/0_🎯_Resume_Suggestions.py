Hey Peter—I put an updated resume below. But before you see it, here are the main things I noticed you could change:

1. **Add a 2–3‑line Professional Summary**  
   Kick off with a snapshot that calls out your core bookkeeping strengths (QuickBooks, month‑end closes, audit support) and one or two hard metrics (e.g., “Reduced close time by 20%,” “Managed \$200K+ in monthly transactions”).

2. **Lead with Your Bookkeeping Role**  
   Create a “Relevant Experience” section and put *"Full Charge Bookkeeper (AcademyX, May 2011–Aug 2013)"* at the very top so hiring managers see your accounting credentials first.

3. **Quantify Every Bullet**  
   Wherever you’ve written “handled” or “processed,” add numbers:  
   - “Reconciled 100+ transactions per month”  
   - “Processed \$200K+ in payables/receivables with a 98% on‑time rate”  
   - “Supported first GAAP/GASB audit”

4. **Include a Skills & Tools Box and Trim Extras**  
   - List: QuickBooks (Online/Desktop), Advanced Excel (PivotTables, Macros, VLOOKUP), GAAP/GASB, month‑end close, budgeting.  
   - In your Digital Marketer role, highlight only the bookkeeping bits (P&L, tax prep).  
   - Drop or shrink the Tutor section if you need more space.

Think of these tweaks as framing your story.
