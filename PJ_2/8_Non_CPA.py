st.title("Navigating Non-CPA Accounting Roles in Oregon")

# --- Introduction ---
st.markdown("""
Oregon offers flexibility for accounting professionals. Unlike some states, **Oregon does not have license requirements for most accounting jobs in private industry or government.** This means you can pursue roles like:

* Accountant
* Bookkeeper
* Financial Analyst
* Accounts Payable/Receivable Specialist
* ...and more!

You can hold these positions without any specific state certification, as long as you **do not represent yourself as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA)**. While many employers value the CPA designation, numerous accounting positions are successfully filled by individuals without it.

Your prior accounting experience, even if it's from some time ago, remains a valuable asset. Combining this experience with evidence that you've kept your skills current is key to landing these roles.

Demonstrating up-to-date knowledge can significantly reassure potential employers.

* **Short Certificates/Courses:** Earning a certificate or completing relevant courses shows commitment to staying current.
    * A certificate in Accounting and Finance or a recognized refresher program can be highlighted on your resume.
    * **Example:** Portland Community College (PCC) offers various [Accounting Degrees, Certificates, & Courses](https://sites.google.com/pcc.edu/accounting-at-pcc/getting-help/accounting-degrees-cert).
    * Taking specific courses in advanced accounting or auditing through professional bodies or local universities can also refresh your knowledge.

While not mandatory, certain credentials can help you stand out:

* **CMA (Certified Management Accountant):** Highly respected in corporate finance.
    * Requires passing a two-part exam covering financial planning, analysis, control, and decision support.
    * **Local Support:** The [IMA Portland Chapter](https://portland.imanet.org/) offers study resources and networking for CMA candidates.
    * **Learn More:** [CMA Certification (IMA Official Site)](https://www.imanet.org/cma-certification)

* **CIA (Certified Internal Auditor):** Beneficial for roles in internal audit departments.
    * Requires passing a three-part exam focused on audit and risk management.
    * **Learn More:** [CIA Certification (IIA Official Site)](https://www.theiia.org/en/certifications/cia/)

* **CPA (Inactive Status):** If you previously held a CPA license that is now inactive but in good standing, Oregon allows you to use the title "CPA Inactive".
    * This signals you achieved the credential at one point.
    * **Note:** Fully reactivating or actively pursuing the CPA license generally holds more weight.
    * **Oregon Rules:** See [OAR 801-010-0120](https://oregon.public.law/rules/oar_801-010-0120) and [Oregon Board of Accountancy - Renewal Info](https://www.oregon.gov/boa/pages/license-renewal-information.aspx#INACTIVE_LICENSEES).

st.header("Don't Overlook Your Experience & Skills")
st.markdown("""
Remember, certifications aren't the only path to success. Many non-CPA accountants thrive based on solid experience and practical skills.

* **Leverage Past Experience:** Your previous accounting work is relevant. Focus on refreshing and demonstrating those skills.
* **Essential Skills:** Proficiency in modern accounting software, strong Excel capabilities, and a solid understanding of current accounting principles are highly valued by employers.
* **Communicate Your Knowledge:** In interviews, be prepared to discuss how you've kept your knowledge current through self-study, courses, or other means. This proactive approach can often suffice for industry roles that don't strictly require a license.

# --- Section 3: Key Takeaway & Next Steps ---
st.header("Key Takeaway and Planning Your Path")
st.markdown("""
* **Define Your Goal:** Decide if pursuing the full CPA license is your objective. If so, map out the necessary steps (education credits, exam preparation, experience requirements). You could potentially study for the exam while working in an entry-level or non-licensed accounting role.
* **Focus on Role Requirements:** If the CPA path isn't your immediate goal, concentrate on meeting the specific requirements (formal or informal) of the non-CPA roles you're targeting. Be aware that some senior accounting positions might still require a bachelor's degree in accounting or a certain number of years of experience, even without demanding a CPA license.
