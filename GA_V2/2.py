        "Developing a Site Suitability Analysis and Preliminary Permitting Pathway for a Utility-Scale Solar Project",
        "Simulating an Interconnection Request and Desktop Feasibility Assessment for a Solar + Storage Project",
        "Building a Pro-Forma Financial Model and Analyzing Key PPA Terms for a Utility-Scale Solar Project",
        "Crafting a Mock Landowner Outreach Strategy and Option Agreement Outline for a Solar Development Project"
    ],
    "Brief Description": [
        "Researching land suitability (GIS data, zoning, environmental screens, transmission proximity) and outlining the key federal, state, and local permits for a hypothetical 100MW solar project.",
        "Outlining the initial steps of an interconnection request process in a chosen RTO/ISO, identifying key data inputs, and performing a high-level desktop analysis of potential interconnection challenges for a 100MW solar + 50MWh storage project.",
        "Developing a simplified pro-forma financial model (inputs: capex, opex, degradation, PPA price, financing assumptions) for a hypothetical solar project and analyzing common terms and risk allocation in a sample Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).",
        "Developing a strategy for identifying and approaching landowners for a utility-scale solar project, and outlining key terms for a land option agreement."
    ],
    "Key Skills/Experience Gained (aligns with JD Requirements)": [
        "Solar siting, land constraint analysis, preliminary environmental/permitting assessment, research of Federal, State & Local solar project permitting.",
        "Interconnection study process understanding, technical considerations for solar + storage, wholesale market/RTO operations awareness, grid evaluation.",
        "Clean energy financial modeling, understanding of PPA structures, project finance concepts, risk analysis.",
        "Land acquisition strategy, landowner negotiation preparation, understanding of land-related legal documentation."
    ],
    "Relevance to Origis Energy's Focus": [
        "Aligns with Origis's need to \"Evaluate transmission grids and land constraints\" and \"Assist in the management of all aspects of solar and storage project permitting.\" Origis has projects in states like FL and TX.",
        "Reflects Origis's work with \"transmission or customer connected\" solutions and the need to \"Support early stage interconnection team with applications, following interconnection process management.\" Origis operates across various RTO/ISO territories.",
        "Supports Origis's activities in \"project finance negotiations support\" and \"PPA negotiations support.\" Financial viability is key to \"insuring solar project bankability\".",
        "Directly addresses the need to \"Interface directly with land owners, land consultants to secure selected sites\" and \"Familiarity with landowner negotiations.\" Origis emphasizes \"Collaborative Community Outcomes\"."
    ],
    "Potential Impact on Candidacy": [
        "Demonstrates analytical skills in site selection, understanding of permitting complexities, and proactive learning in core development tasks.",
        "Showcases understanding of grid integration, a critical step in project development, and familiarity with RTO/ISO procedures.",
        "Demonstrates financial acumen relevant to project development, ability to assess project economics, and understanding of PPA dynamics.",
        "Highlights skills in a crucial early-stage development activity, demonstrating an understanding of securing land rights and initiating community relations."
