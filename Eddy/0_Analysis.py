        The term **"Sports Therapist"** does not represent a distinct, formally licensed profession within the
        United States, including the state of Oklahoma, in the same way it might be recognized in other
        countries, such as the United Kingdom or Abu Dhabi.

        In the U.S. context, individuals who work with athletes and active populations on the prevention,
        assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation of injuries are typically either:
        * **Athletic Trainers (ATs)**
        * **Physical Therapists (PTs)**

        Physical Therapists may further choose to specialize in sports. It is important to understand this
        distinction from the outset, as pursuing a non-existent or non-licensed "sports therapist"
        credential would not lead to a viable career path in Oklahoma.

        The focus of this report, therefore, will be on the established and licensed professions of
        **Athletic Training** and **Physical Therapy** with a sports emphasis.

        Some sources note that *"sports physical therapy, often known as sports therapy, is a type of
        physical treatment that focuses on sports teams and athletes"*. This underscores that the desired
        role likely falls under the umbrella of sports-focused physical therapy or athletic training.
